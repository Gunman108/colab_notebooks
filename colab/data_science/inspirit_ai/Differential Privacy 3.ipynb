Note that $F$ is typically a randomized function, so that the probability distribution describing its outputs is not just a point distribution.\n","\n","The important implication of this definition is that $F$'s output will be pretty much the same, with or without the data of any specific individual. In other words, the randomness built into $F$ should be \"enough\" so that an observed output from $F$ will not reveal which of $x$ or $x'$ was the input. Imagine that my data is present in $x$ but not in $x'$. If an adversary can't determine which of $x$ or $x'$ was the input to $F$, then the adversary can't tell whether or not my data was present in the input - let alone the contents of that data.\n","\n","The $\\epsilon$ parameter in the definition is called the **privacy parameter** or the privacy budget. $\\epsilon$ provides a knob to tune the \"amount of privacy\" the definition provides. Small values of $\\epsilon$ require $F$ to provide very similar outputs when given similar inputs, and therefore provide higher levels of privacy; large values of $\\epsilon$ allow less similarity in the outputs, and therefore provide less privacy.\n","\n","How should we set $\\epsilon$ to prevent bad outcomes in practice? Nobody knows. The general consensus is that $\\epsilon$ should be around 1 or smaller, and values of $\\epsilon$ above 10 probably don't do much to protect privacy - but this rule of thumb could turn out to be very conservative.

Sequential composition is also important when multiple separate analyses are performed on a single dataset, since it allows individuals to bound the total privacy cost they incur by participating in all of these analyses. The bound on privacy cost given by sequential composition is an *upper bound* - the actual privacy cost of two particular differentially private releases may be smaller than this, but never larger.\n","\n","The principle that the $\\epsilon$s \"add up\" makes sense if we examine the distribution of outputs from a mechanism which averages two differentially private results together.

Parallel composition can be seen as an alternative to sequential composition - a second way to calculate a bound on the total privacy cost of multiple data releases. Parallel composition is based on the idea of splitting your dataset into disjoint chunks and running a differentially private mechanism on each chunk separately. Since the chunks are disjoint, each individual's data appears in exactly one chunk - so even if there are $k$ chunks in total (and therefore $k$ runs of the mechanism), the mechanism runs exactly once on the data of each individual.

In this notebook, we took a look at some fundamental theory behind differential privacy. You learned how linking attacks can be conducted, thus proving the need for differential privacy.

You learned how differential privacy is able to effectively handle malicious queries. And you learned about sequential and parallel composition and how they compare, with their tradeoff between privacy and accuracy. See you all next time!"]}]}
